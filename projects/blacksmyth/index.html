<h1> Blacksmyth </h1>

<p>

Blacksmyth is an extension to the Smyth project that supports
finding and resynthesizing library functions in incomplete programs.
<br>
Blacksmyth aims to support a library file containing function headings left undefined.
If a target program is found to have used one of the functions within the library,
Blacksmyth will reintroduce the function as a sketch within the code.
Blacksmyth will then call the Smyth toolchain to attempt to repair the program
and render it usable again.
<br>
We would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/UChicago-PL/smyth">the original Smyth team</a> for the baseline program synthesis tool
and <a href="https://github.com/david-broman/ocaml-examples">David Broman</a>
for his very helpful tutorials and sample code on lexing and parsing in OCaml.
<br>
Further commit history can be found <a href="https://github.com/jhawkreynolds/blacksmythparser">here</a>.
<br>
The remainder of this README details installation steps for Smyth.
Installing from this repository requires no further instructions.
