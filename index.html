    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Jack, and I'm a graduate student at the University of Kansas
        studying Computer Science. My current area of research is in programming languages
        and formal methods, and my career aspiration is to teach
        beginning programming courses to college students.
    </p>
    <h3>My interests and hobbies</h3>
    <p>
        I can speak intermediate-level Spanish,
        and I can play the saxophone alright and the piano a fair amount worse.
        I thoroughly enjoy the <i>Pokemon</i> video games, 
        and have completed the regional pokedexes for Alola and Paldea.
        I have attempted some challenge runs, and a tool I made for one of them
        can be found on my website <a href="/bwstabless/">here</a>.
        Some of my other favorite games include
        <i>Minecraft</i>, <i>Undertale</i>, <i>Terraria</i>, <i>Portal</i>,
        and most of the <i>Super Mario</i> series, especially
        <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>, <i>Super Mario World</i>, and <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting a hold of me</h3>
    <p>
        If you would like to contact me, my email is the safest option.
        Feel free to address me by my first name, full name, 
        or "Mr. Reynolds" if you're feeling fancy.
        If you are not in my contacts 
        (and sometimes even if you are,
        as my family knows and righfully makes fun of me for),
        I can not guarantee I will pick up the phone.
    </p>
