    <h1>What are HTML, JS, and CSS?</h1>
    <p style="width:50%">
    The three languages of HTML, JS, and CSS are the foundation of the modern web.
    These three languages are used to display data to the user,
    and each have different functions.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p style="width:50%">
    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language,
    is a programming language that functions as the structure of the page.
    HTML uses a number of tags to store data like boxes inside boxes.
    <br>
    You can write a webpage solely in HTML.
    However, with only HTML you cannot create any interactive elements,
    and your page will look pretty gross.
    <br>
    This is where the other two languages come into play.
    </p>
    <h2>JS</h2>
    <p style="width:50%">
    JS, or JavaScript,
    is a programming language that can be used to create scripts that do tasks,
    hence its name.
    <br>
    The use of JavaScript is very similar to Python; 
    it doesn't have any fancy graphics on its own,
    but it can make variables, do math, and run functions.
    <br>
    JavaScript is necessary to make anything interactive on your page.
    You can use a object you made in HTML to trigger a script that will
    update your page to display something new. 
    Your scripts can be written into your HTML code or exist as standalone
    .js files.
    </p>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p style="width:50%">
    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets,
    is a programming language that is used solely for graphics.
    <br>
    Understanding CSS is not immediately needed to understand web graphics,
    as all of your HTML objects have default styles in CSS.
    <br>
    However, you may want to change the style of objects in your page
    for a variety of reasons. You can edit the CSS styling of objects
    within the HTML file itself, with a script in JavaScript, or with
    a separate .css file.
